# LoRA for Deep Learning
Exploring LoRA's capabilities for training deep learning models

## Possible Things to Explore
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Fine-tuning pretrained CNN models on image classification
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Fine-tuning pretrained BERT models on sentiment analysis
- Saving model (adapter only then merge compared with saving the entire model)
  - track the load time
  - track memory usage

## Things to Check
- model's performance on the task (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, TP, FP, FN, TN, etc.)
- training time & validation time
- LoRA's hyperparameter (alpha, r)
